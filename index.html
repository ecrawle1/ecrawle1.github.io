        <p>I am a Data Specialist at Kent State University’s Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid, where I develop and optimize SQL reports, support compliance processes, and collaborate with IT and cross-functional teams to 	 	streamline student aid operations. My work focuses on turning complex data into practical insights that improve both efficiency and student experience.</p>
	<p>Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Business Analytics at Kent State. This program builds on my strong background in data management and reporting while expanding my skills in predictive modeling, visualization, and 	decision science.</p>
	<p>Outside of my professional role, I enjoy mentoring students through robotics programs such as FIRST LEGO League and FIRST Tech Challenge, where creativity and problem-solving meet teamwork and technology. My lifelong 	interests in nature, science, and storytelling continue to shape the way I approach challenges—combining evidence, imagination, and exploration.</p>
