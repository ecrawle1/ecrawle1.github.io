        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a Data Specialist at Kent State University’s Office of Scholarships &amp; Financial Aid,
          where I build SQL-driven solutions, streamline processes in Ellucian Banner 9 and NextGen Dynamic
          Forms, and collaborate with IT and functional teams to improve data quality, compliance, and the
          student experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My path moved from administrative support to data and application development, and I thrive at the
          intersection of problem-solving, communication, and secure, efficient systems.
        </p>

        <h2>Professional Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Technology and data should empower people. I focus on translating complex requirements into clear,
          reliable solutions—pairing curiosity and documentation with an emphasis on accuracy, accessibility,
          and outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          I mentor students in FIRST LEGO League and FIRST Tech Challenge—where creativity, coding, and
          teamwork come together. Lifelong interests in science, nature, and storytelling shape how I
          approach challenges: with evidence, imagination, and exploration.
